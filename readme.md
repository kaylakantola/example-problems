# Example Problems

If you learn by doing, and you are interested in javascript, this repo is for you!

Specifically, this is intended for use by people who are thinking of doing a javascript bootcamp.

This assumes you have maybe already done some self-teaching, and you need some practical problems to solve in order to get to the next level. 

If you can complete the tasks in all the folders here, you'll be ahead of the curve and get the most out of your bootcamp experience (which is great, because those things are expensive!).

This isn't exhaustive, but it is a nice start! 

I intend to continually update this repo with more example problems. 

## Table of Contents

This is my recommended order of approach, but you can do whatever you want!

1. Setting up your computer
2. Command Line
3. Javascript
4. React
5. APIs
6. Git
