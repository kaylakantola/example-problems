# Javascript 

## Example problems: Movies

Check out the file in this folder called `movies.js`.

Download that file and work through the problems!

When you think you have the functions filled in and working correctly, run this in your terminal (make sure you are in the correct folder):

```sh
node movies.js
```

If you did it right, it should console.log out the results of your functions.
