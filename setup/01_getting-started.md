# Getting Started

I remember at the beginning of my coding experience, the internals of my computer felt very foreign to me. 

I felt overwhelmed by configuration options. 

So, my goal here is to give you a good baseline of what you need to have locally configured in order to do all the things. 

If you are running through this exercise, and you encounter an error or something doesn't go smoothly, please open up an an [issue](https://github.com/kaylakantola/example-problems/issues/new) and describe what went wrong so I can update this file.

At first I was going to do explanations of what each thing is and why, but it quickly started taking way too long. So if you want to know what something is, just google it - googling stuff is like, 90% of being a developer anyway :) 

## Code Editor
[Atom](https://atom.io/) - it is free and no-frills and not too overwhelming.

Bonus: install atom's command line tools, how-to [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23666354)

## Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is probably going to not make any sense to you right now and that's totally ok. 

## Node & NPM

[Here is an article](https://medium.com/@hayasnc/how-to-install-nodejs-and-npm-on-mac-using-homebrew-b33780287d8f) on how to install node and npm via homebrew. 

## Postman 

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) will come in handy once you get to the APIs section.

## Oh My Zsh 

[This makes your terminal look nice!](https://ohmyz.sh/)
